# HR Life Cycle

This project features the entire HR life cycle of a fictional private healthcare facility. It includes
topics such as recruiting strategies, onboarding, employee retention and offboarding. The
goal was to create an efficient and practical framework by combining aspects of work and
organizational psychology with technical tools like ClickUp, Excel and Google Sheets. The PDF can be found [here](https://github.com/lea-schreiner/HR-Life-Cycle/blob/main/HR%20Life%20Cycle%20Project.pdf)

## Importance of the Project
This project shows how psychological knowledge about topics such as employee motivation,
conflict resolution and organizational behavior can help improve the recruiting process,
reduce turnover rates and manage HR practices more effectively. As a psychology student
who is passionate about human behavior and motivation, this project was a great opportunity
to integrate everything Iâ€™ve learned so far into a creative and practical solution for an ongoing
real life problem within the workforce.
